# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and represents my first JavaScript project with a basic user interface.

The game is played in the browser by clicking on buttons, and the score is displayed on the page.

Future improvements may include styling and animations.
